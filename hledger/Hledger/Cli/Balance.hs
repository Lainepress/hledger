A ledger-compatible @balance@ command.

ledger's balance command is easy to use but not easy to describe
precisely.  In the examples below we'll use sample.journal, which has the
following account tree:

@
 assets
   bank
     checking
     saving
   cash
 expenses
   food
   supplies
 income
   gifts
   salary
 liabilities
   debts
@

The balance command shows accounts with their aggregate balances.
Subaccounts are displayed indented below their parent. Each balance is the
sum of any transactions in that account plus any balances from
subaccounts:

@
 $ hledger -f sample.journal balance
                 $-1  assets
                  $1    bank:saving
                 $-2    cash
                  $2  expenses
                  $1    food
                  $1    supplies
                 $-2  income
                 $-1    gifts
                 $-1    salary
                  $1  liabilities:debts
@

Usually, the non-interesting accounts are elided or omitted. Above,
@checking@ is omitted because it has no subaccounts and a zero balance.
@bank@ is elided because it has only a single displayed subaccount
(@saving@) and it would be showing the same balance as that ($1). Ditto
for @liabilities@. We will return to this in a moment.

The --depth argument can be used to limit the depth of the balance report.
So, to see just the top level accounts:

@
$ hledger -f sample.journal balance --depth 1
                 $-1  assets
                  $2  expenses
                 $-2  income
                  $1  liabilities
@

This time liabilities has no displayed subaccounts (due to --depth) and
is not elided.

With one or more account pattern arguments, the balance command shows
accounts whose name matches one of the patterns, plus their parents
(elided) and subaccounts. So with the pattern o we get:

@
 $ hledger -f sample.journal balance o
                  $1  expenses:food
                 $-2  income
                 $-1    gifts
                 $-1    salary
--------------------
                 $-1
@

The o pattern matched @food@ and @income@, so they are shown. Unmatched
parents of matched accounts are also shown (elided) for context (@expenses@).

Also, the balance report shows the total of all displayed accounts, when
that is non-zero. Here, it is displayed because the accounts shown add up
to $-1.

Also, non-interesting accounts may be elided.  Here's an imperfect
description of the ledger balance command's eliding behaviour:
\"Interesting\" accounts are displayed on their own line. An account less
deep than the report's max depth, with just one interesting subaccount,
and the same balance as the subaccount, is non-interesting, and prefixed
to the subaccount's line, unless (hledger's) --no-elide is in effect.
An account with a zero inclusive balance and less than two interesting
subaccounts is not displayed at all, unless --empty is in effect.

This implementation turned out to be a bit convoluted but implements the following algorithm for formatting:

- If there is a single amount, print it with the account name directly:
- Otherwise, only print the account name on the last line.

    a         USD 1   ; Account 'a' has a single amount
              EUR -1
    b         USD -1  ; Account 'b' has two amounts. The account name is printed on the last line.
