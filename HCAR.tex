hledger is a library and end-user tool (with command-line, curses and web
interfaces) for converting, recording, and analyzing financial
transactions, using a simple human-editable plain text file format. It is
a haskell port and friendly fork of John Wiegley's Ledger, licensed under
GNU GPLv3+.

hledger aims to be a reliable, practical tool for daily use. It reports
charts of accounts or account balances, filters transactions by type,
helps you record new transactions, converts CSV data from your bank,
publishes your text journal with a rich web interface, generates simple
charts, and provides an API for use in your own financial scripts and
apps.

In the last six months there have been two major releases. 0.15 focussed
on features and 0.16 focussed on quality. Changes include:

- new modal command-line interface, extensible with hledger-* executables in the path
- more useful web interface, with real account registers and basic charts
- hledger-web no longer needs to create support files, and uses latest yesod & warp
- more ledger compatibility
- misc command enhancements, API improvements, bug fixes, documentation updates
- lines of code increased by 3k to 8k
- project committers increased by 6 to 21

Current plans include:

- Continue the release rhythm of odd-numbered = features, even-numbered =
  quality/stability/polish, and releasing on the first of a month

- In 0.17, clean up the storage layer, allow rcs integration via
  filestore, and read (or convert) more formats

- Keep working towards wider usefulness, improving the web interface and
  providing standard financial reports
