# hledger

hledger is a computer program for easily tracking money, time, or other
commodities, inspired by [ledger](http://ledger-cli.org). It is quite
limited in features, but lightweight and reliable. For some, it is a
bare-bones, simpler, less expensive alternative to Quicken or GnuCash.  It
is available for free under the GNU General Public License.

hledger aims to help both computer experts and every-day users gain
clarity in their finances and time management. I use it every day
to:

-   track spending and income
-   see time reports by day/week/month/project
-   get accurate numbers for client billing and tax filing
-   track invoices

The [manual](MANUAL.html) and [screenshots](SCREENSHOTS.html) will explain
more, including
[differences from ledger](FAQ.html#how-does-hledger-relate-to-ledger). There's
also a [demo](http://demo.hledger.org) of hledger's web interface. To get
started tracking your own numbers, [download](DOWNLOAD.html) a copy.
